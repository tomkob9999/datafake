# datafake

This tool is to generate random "fake" test data.


# Highlights
- written in vanilla Javascript (thus, fast)
- no server side processing
- visually enhanced by Bootstrap 5 ( https://getbootstrap.com )
- personal information generation is powered by Faker.js ( https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/ )
- original Japanese name, address and text generation/conversion modules are included (these libraries are not light, but quite powerful)
# Usage

You can access the Github Pages site directly ( https://tomkob9999.github.io/datafake/ ).

Alternatively, you can download the source codes and run on your PC by downloading the zip file and unzipping.  Then, you can launch index.html on the browser of your choice (typically double-clicking the file).
